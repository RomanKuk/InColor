This is my first Android app, course project.
InColor is an app that allows user to get more about computer graphics: color models and Newton`s fractals.
Main functions:
- user can take a photo and add a colourful filter choosing RGB manually, at the same time user can see this color in other colour models (HEX, HSL, CMYK, HSV)
- user can generate Newton's fractals setting the function
- user can save and share taken photo with filter and generated Newton's fractal
- user gets notification "Color of the day"
